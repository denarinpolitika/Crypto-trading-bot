Losers branch contains losing strategies which were developed and backtested by me and were unsuccessful because of various reasons. Small profit factor, small overall return and with that small cumulative return. So these strategies were either lacklustre or too good to be true.
Winners are strategies that have a profit factor anywhere from 1 to 3 and have a yearly return of 10% or so. the ratio between drawdown (%) and overall profit (%) had to be at least 1/3.


Strategy MACDSMA200hyperopt2.py  has undergone a hyper-optimisation once, given that it showed promising and realistic results on the backtest. It's now been tested live on the crypto markets for several months now.
