Building algorithmic trading strategies for an open-source crypto bot Freqtrade

Losers branch contains losing strategies which were developed and backtested by me and were unsuccessful because of various reasons. Small profit factor, small overall return and with that small cumulative return. So these strategies were either lacklustre or too good to be true.
Winners are strategies with a profit factor anywhere from 1 to 3 and a yearly return of 10% or so. the ratio between drawdown (%) and overall profit (%) had to be at least 1/3.


Strategy MACDSMA200hyperopt2.py  has undergone a hyper-optimisation once, given that it showed promising and realistic results on the backtest. It's been tested live on the crypto markets for several months.

I also added a branch where I posted a script which automatically opened charts from my meme coin positions.
